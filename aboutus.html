	<h2 align="center" class="title">What Makes Us Unique?</h2>
<p>
<h2>One travel expert throughout</h2>
Many agencies force you to deal with multiple people throughout the booking process, making it disjointed and impersonal. At Crystal Travel you will deal with the same travel expert from the moment of initial contact until you are safely back at home.
 <br>

<h2>Visit us in person</h2>
Unlike many other agencies who do their business solely online or even from abroad, we still keep regular office hours and are delighted when with planned visits or drop-ins to our West Roxbury office.

<br>
<h2>Quality is our focus</h2>
We insist on prompt and pleasant customer service and the best hotels, visitor attractions and entertainment. By sharing with you the hidden places not mentioned in guidebooks, the local people you wouldnâ€™t otherwise meet and the traditions you may not have experienced by yourself, we ensure that you get an authentic and enhanced experience you simply could not have had on your own.

<br>
<h2>Personal service</h2>
Our team here is friendly and affable. We are specialists in the destinations that we offer and possess deep product knowledge about them. We will offer you a personal service and will handle your booking from start to finish ensuring that all your travel needs are met.
<br>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
At Crystal Travel, we strive to earn repeat business from you and want you to recommend us to your friends and family. Your referrals are extremely valuable to us and we know that we have to work diligently to deserve them.

<br>
<h2>Experience & Accuracy</h2>
Our staff are experienced, well-traveled and have years of travel knowledge among them. They draw upon their own first-hand experiences when customizing vacations for you.

<br>
<h2>Accredited & Licensed</h2>
Crystal Travel has full accreditation with the Airlines Reporting Corporation (for meeting and maintaining the rigorous financial, personnel, and business standards as defined in ARC's Agent Reporting Agreement) and a bond with them for sale of airline tickets via IAR. We also have a license to sell travel insurance as well as the City of Boston business license.
